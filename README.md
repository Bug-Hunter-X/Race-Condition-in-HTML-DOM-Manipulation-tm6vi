This repository demonstrates a race condition in HTML where JavaScript attempts to access and modify a DOM element before the browser's rendering engine has finished parsing the HTML. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the JavaScript failing silently or only partially updating the element. The solution shows how to properly use the `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure the element is available before manipulation.
